# Needs 1

* If the android version is lower or equal to 9, we suggest it to install virtual_xposed (We bind virtual_xposed as an built-in apk file)
* We release those apks we have under download folder as `Downloads/atlantis/apk/*`, we use code to open that folder
* In our UI, we have a tab where has all built-in apps. At the top, has an button called 'Install APKs Manually', when user click it, we show a window says "We will open ~/Downloads/atlantis/apk folder, you can install app manually from there.", then we open that folder.
