State of the Project, Feature Requests, etc.
===

Since Atlantis simply makes use of the Work Profile APIs exposed by Android, there is a limited set of features that are possible to implement via the app. As we do not intend on leveraging (or "abusing") adb privileges, the features of Atlantis can only be a strict subset of the exposed, unprivileged APIs.

As a result, we do not intend on adding a lot of new features to Atlantis going forward, unless there is to be big changes in the capabilities of work profile APIs. Atlantis is currently in an effective **maintenance mode**. Nevertheless, the author is still committed to regularly **adapting Atlantis to all new Android versions as soon as possible after they are released** -- this includes upgrading the target SDK level, adapting to any new features or restrictions introduced by the new Android version, updating all dependencies, and so on. The author still relies on Atlantis for his daily life, so Atlantis will **not** become abandonware in the forseeable future.
