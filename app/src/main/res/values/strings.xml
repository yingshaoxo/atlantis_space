    <!-- Setup Wizard -->
    <string name="setup_wizard_welcome">Welcome to Atlantis</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_welcome_text">Atlantis is an application to help you run other applications in an isolated profile. It does so by making use of the <b>Work Profile</b> feature of Android.\n\nClick \"Next\", and we will provide you with more information about Atlantis, and guide you through the setup process.\n\nWe suggest that you read through all of the following pages carefully.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_permissions">A word on permissions</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_permissions_text">By default, Atlantis will not ask for any individual permissions. However, once you proceed with the setup process, Atlantis will try to set up a Work Profile and hence become the <b>profile manager</b> of said profile.\n\nThis will grant Atlantis an extensive list of permissions inside the profile, comparable to that of a Device Admin, albeit confined to the profile. Being the profile manager is necessary for most of Atlantis\'s functionality.\n\nSome advanced features of Atlantis may require more permissions <b>outside</b> the Work Profile. When needed, Atlantis will ask for those permissions separately when you enable the corresponding features.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_compatibility">Compatibility</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_compatibility_text">Atlantis is developed and tested on AOSP-like Android derivatives. This includes AOSP (Android Open Source Project), Google Android (on Pixels), and <b>most AOSP-based open-source custom ROMs</b> such as LineageOS. If your phone is running one of the Android derivatives listed above, then congratulations! Atlantis is probably going to work correctly on your device.\n\nSome device vendors introduce very invasive customizations into the Android code base, resulting in conflicts, incompatibility and unexpected behavior. Some custom ROMs can also introduce compatibility-breaking changes, but generally these are rarer occurrences compared to phone vendor-introduced incompatibilities.\n\nAtlantis is merely an interface into the Work Profile feature provided by the system. If the feature provided by the system is broken or non-standard, <b>Atlantis could not magically resolve the issue on its own</b>. If you are currently using a vendor-modified Android version that is known to break Work Profiles, <b>you have been warned</b>. You may proceed anyway, but there is no guarantee that Atlantis would behave correctly under these circumstances.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_ready">Ready?</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_ready_text">We are now ready to set up Atlantis for you. If your device is running Android 7 or lower, please first ensure that your device is <b>not</b> in Do Not Disturb mode, because you will need to <b>click on a notification</b> later to finalize the setup process.\n\nWhen you are ready, click on \"Next\" to begin the setup process.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_please_wait">Please waitâ€¦</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_please_wait_text">We are trying to initialize Work Profile and set up Atlantis on your device.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_failed">Setup failed</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_failed_text">We regret to inform you that we were not able to set up Atlantis for you.\n\nIf your device already had a Work Profile, either from a previous installation of Atlantis or from another application, you will have to remove that profile in Settings -> Account before Atlantis can proceed.\n\nOtherwise, if you did not cancel the setup manually, then the reason for the failure is most commonly due to a heavily modified system, or a conflict between Atlantis and other Work Profile managers. Unfortunately, there is not much that we could do about this.\n\nClick \"Next\" to exit.</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_action_required">Action required</string>
    <string name="setup_wizard_action_required_text">You should now be seeing a notification from Atlantis. <b>Please click on that notification</b> to finish the setup process.\n\nIf you do not see the notification, make sure your device is not in Do Not Disturb mode and try pulling down the notification center.\n\nTo reset Atlantis and start over, you can clear the data of Atlantis in Settings.</string>
